multibit color server and client
================================

This is a color aware fork of multibit, which uses bitcoinj as a bitcoin server and has a trading tab in the UI, which sends proposals and fulfilments through the message server.

It doesn't quite work yet, and the color server is not yet seperated from the client, but we are working on it.

Compiling and running it should be very much like compuling and running ordinary multibit, but a lot of the added functionality is hard coded, written in dropbox or just plain missing.
