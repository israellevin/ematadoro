Bitcoin server
==============

Just a thin wrapper which exposes specific capabilities of bitcoind. In the future we want to do the same thing to bitcoinj, and maybe even write our own standalone server.

Make sure you have bitcoind running with the provided bitcoin.conf, you do not want to accidentally run this with a mainnet wallet - it is not secure.
