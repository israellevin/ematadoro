ngccc color server
==================

This is a spall path over Alex's ngccc-server, which implements the required API calls of a color server.

To install it, follow the instructions in ngcccbase's README.

To run it, run:
```
ngccc-server.py localhost 6711
```

Note that ngccc-server is currently hardcoded to run in testnet mode.
